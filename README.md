# First Project - Data Analysis
## Description
This project is centered around exploratory data 
analysis (EDA) techniques and statistical analysis, 
as well as modeling data using linear regression.

This is the first project during the bootcamp at neue fische in hamburg.
Here I'm working with the King County House Sales dataset.
The focus is on EDA (exploratory data analysis).

## The data
The dataset "King_County_House_prices_dataset.csv", in the folder /data.
The description of the column names can be found in the column_names.md file in this repository.

## Tasks 
Through statistical analysis/EDA, above please come up with AT LEAST 3 (you can definitely get bonus points for more than 3) recommendations for home sellers and/or buyers in King County.
Then model this dataset with a multivariate linear regression to predict the sale price of houses as accurately as possible.
Acceptable R squared values = 0.7 to 0.9
Optional: 
Split the dataset into a train and a test set. 
Use Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) as your metric of success and try to minimize this score on your test data.

## Result
The result of the project can be found in the attached jupyter notebbook and in the slides which are attached as well.
